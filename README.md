# MIPS-Assembly
- Description: the program will take in inputs as the dimensions (width and height) of the 2 matrices and a threshold number for random value generator, then it will generate 2 matrices
represented as 2 2D arrays, their elements are assigned with random value uniformly distributed from 0 to the threshold number. If the dimesions of input matrices are valid
the program will then perform matrix multiplication and the result will be written to a file along with the two input matrices.

- I also wrote a C++ program to validate the result.

- The program is in EX5 file, to run it, simply download the mips mars simulator program then run this file on the software.
